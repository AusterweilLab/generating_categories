<p>Excellent!<br><br>
  For the next stage of this experiment, you
  will be presented with a series of the same figures.
	<br/><br>
	However your task this time is to specify how good, or
	typical, you think that figure is as a member of its
	category. You will choose from a sliding scale ranging
	from 0 (this figure is a not a good or typical member of
	its category) to 10 (this figure is a very good or very
	typical member of its category.)
	<br><br>
	There are no right or wrong answers. Please respond with
	your gut reaction.
