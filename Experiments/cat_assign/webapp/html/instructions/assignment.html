<div id='instructions'>

<p>In this experiment, you will observe geometric figures like the ones
below:</p>

<div class = 'samples'>
	<div class = "stimsample" id = "sample1"></div>
	<div class = "stimsample" id = "sample2"></div>
	<div class = "stimsample" id = "sample3"></div>
	<div class = "stimsample" id = "sample4"></div>
</div>

<p>
  Some figures belong to a category called "Alpha", while others belong to a
  category called "Beta".
  <br><br>
  Your task is to categorize the figures as best as you can. The figures that
  you will see will appear one at a time. Each time it appears, you will be asked
  which category it belongs to. After you provide a response, the correct answer
  will be also be given as feedback.

  <br><br>
  At first, you will not know anything about the categories and will be
  guessing. As you receive more and more feedback, you should be able to learn
  the categories.
  <br><br>
  Some categories may be difficult to learn. You will have plenty of chances with
  each item. Over time, categorizing correctly will get easier.
