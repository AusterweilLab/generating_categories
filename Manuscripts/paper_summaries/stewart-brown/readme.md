McLaren et al., (1995) distinguished between the prototype and peak shift effects. Using checkerboard stimuli across 3 experiments (the differences between these experiments don’t appear too important), they distinguish the prototype and peak shift effects. The prototype effect is when the categorisation of a previously-unseen (and untrained) prototype is more accurate than the categorisation of previously seen exemplars (which were derived from the prototype). The prototype effect doesn’t seem quite relevant to our manuscript, so I won’t go further into this effect. The peak shift effect, however, describes the increase in categorisation ‘accuracy' of more extreme transfer (i.e., untrained) exemplars than than previously trained exemplars. The assumption here is that the stimuli are categorised with some simple rule (can be separated by a single line in 2-d similarity space?). 

Thoughts: Ok - I think this is interesting, but I am not sure we can use this to show the strength of models that involve category contrast (both SD-GCM and PACKER) because standard GCM can predict peak shift (see int/ext and diagonal conditions of Nosofsky 1986 – more extreme stimuli here have higher frequencies of a particular category label than less extreme stimuli). Stewart and Brown (2005) talk about this as a strength of SD-GCM, but they also don’t show how the GCM cannot do this (I've noted this as a weaker section of their paper). McLaren and colleagues (1995) mention GCM only to show how it makes the wrong predictions in the relative strength of prototype vs peak shift, but this doesn't seem to be something PACKER is (currently) concerned (currently) with.

[One possible avenue for future work - to see if GCM and SD-GCM can distinguish between prototype vs peak shift, and if PACKER can do better?]

Stewart, Brown, and Chater (2002) demonstrate the category contrast effect across two categorization experiments (first involving tones varying in frequency, and second involving semicircles+radial lines (as used in Nosofsky 1986 and others)). Importantly, SBC discuss importance of contrast, but only in a sequential context. That is, the probability of assigning a category label on a trial n is determined by the difference in similarity between the stimulus on trial n and the stimulus on trial n-1. Notably, they do not go in-depth into how within-category similarity should affect categorisation. Instead, they qualitatively test the predictions of MAC (a fairly extreme contrast-only model) with the predictions of GCM. No quantitative fits, so can’t tell if MAC is overall better than GCM.

Thoughts: A relatively straightforward paper that formally introduces the idea that contrast (albeit in a sequential sense) is important in categorization. I’d imagine this would be good to cite in the introduction to PACKER, but not really worth going into much discussion (i.e., similar to how S&B 2005 uses this paper).

Stewart and Brown (2004) extend MAC (from SBC 2002) to consider not only the difference in stimuli between the current trial and the immediately  preceding trial, but any one of the preceding trials (with some decreasing probability the further back we go). They also vary MAC in 4 ways. 
     A) Guessing model – simply guesses each category response
     B) Feedback repetition model – responds with the same label given as feedback in the previous trial
     C) Recalled stimulus model – responds with the same label given as feedback on some previously recalled trial. 
     D) Same as SBC (2002) but extended to stimuli from any of the preceding trials (or more correctly, any of the most-recently recalled stimulus)

S&B note that only model D (i.e., the original MAC from SBC 2002) considers magnitude between stimuli - the others only consider the direction of differences (S&B describe it as sign-useful). Essentially, if the stimulus on the current trial is farther away from the category boundary than the stimulus on the most recently recalled trial, then the correct category label will be assigned. Otherwise, responses can vary from MAC versions A to D as described above. Anyway, the reason I mention this is because S&B tested participants on categorizing tones of varying frequency, and their results suggested that magnitude (i.e., model D) isn’t important; instead, model C appeared to fit best.

Thoughts: Similar to SBC (2002), in that this paper can be used to show that contrasts between stimuli are important in categorisation, but not much more beyond this at this point. The apparent absence of the influence of magnitude difference shown in this paper though is something I might want to think about a little more.

Stewart, Brown, and Chater (2005) develop a novel model of identification: relative judgment model (RJM). In contrast to most previous models, RJM assumes that the difference between the current and previous stimuli is the main determinant of an identification response, as opposed to a response drawn from some absolute magnitude representation of the current stimulus. This sounds a little similar to MAC, but unlike MAC, it’s designed for identification, and also appears to be more complex (see specifications on p.892). Also unlike MAC, it accounts for assimilation effect (among other identification phenomena), where responses on a current trial are biased towards the immediately preceding stimulus. I don’t think MAC makes any specific prediction of that (also I'm not sure if there’s a categorization version of assimilation effect). 

Thoughts: I do not currently see anything really useful we can learn from this paper that would be of direct relevance to our manuscript, other than the idea (similar to SBC 2002, S&B 2004) that differences between current and previous stimuli are important. However, this is some comprehensive work on a few effects in the identification literature. If we eventually want to apply PACKER to identification tasks, it may be worth getting deeper into this paper.
